# Projectdescription: Fakestore-Api

This project is a React application that fetches products from a public API and displays them on a website. The website consists of various pages, including a homepage where the products are displayed in a list and a product detail page where users can view more information about a selected product.

### Technology Stack:

React.js: The project is built on React.js, a popular JavaScript framework for front-end development.
React Router: React Router is used to enable navigation between different pages of the application.
Fetch API: The application retrieves product information from an external API using the Fetch API.
Functionalities:

### Homepage (Home):
On this page, products are displayed in a list view. Each product is presented with an image, a title, a price, and a "Read More" link. Users can click on "Read More" to view more details about a product.

### Product Detail Page (ProductDetails): 
This page provides detailed information about a selected product. The information includes the product image, title, price, and a description. Users navigate to this page by clicking "Read More" on the homepage.

### Navigation (NavBar): 
The navigation bar is displayed on all pages, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the application.

The project leverages React and React Router to create a dynamic user interface, giving users the ability to view product information. It also maintains a clear separation between components and pages to keep the code maintainable and extensible.
